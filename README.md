# huffman
Decode an encoded string by constructing huffman tree
Example input:
9 0 6 3 2 8 4
6 0 2 3 8 9 4
0001011011100011
Example output:
6 2 8 3 0 4 9
62448468

In the input, the first line is the preorder traversal of the tree,
              the second line is the inorder traversal of the tree,
              the thirdd line is encoded sequence of the value.
In the output, the first line is the postorder traversal of the tree,
               the second line is the decoded sequence of the value.
